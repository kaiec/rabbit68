## Layout

http://www.keyboard-layout-editor.com/#/gists/c885816c6b763c657e40474b015e362b

## Design Principles

- Basis for experiments and customization at low cost.
- Ortholinear
- Only keys without stabilizers, i.e., 1.75 U maximum.
- Key sizes that are available in a standard (blank) qwerty keycaps set.
- No SMD

## Piggybacked Teensy 2.0

The PCB uses a Teensy 2.0 as controller. This way the whole PCB is basically just to avoid handwiring.
